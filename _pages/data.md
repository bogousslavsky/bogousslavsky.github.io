### Informed trading data

Informed trading intensity (ITI) measures are at the stock by day level and are designed to study how informed trading changes in a given stock over time.

### High-frequency order imbalance volatility data

We compute share imbalance as a proportion of shares outstanding over every five-minute interval of the trading day using the Lee and Ready (1991) algorithm. High-frequency order imbalance volatility (HFOIV ) is the standard deviation of the five-minute imbalance, computed over the trading day.

Current data (2002-2017):
- Stock-day HFOIV for NYSE, Amex, and NASDAQ common stocks
